# weather-app

The website: https://weather-app-8cd06.web.app/

A simple weather app that displays the weather and the latest news created by <a href="https://github.com/AlexisHampton">Alexis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iamX2001">Jevi, and <a href="https://github.com/Micahscodingjourney">Micah</a> in one week!

Alexis: accessed apis and stored them in the firestore database
Jevi: crafted the front end UI and 
Micah: created the cool graphs that should have been on the site

Hardships
We could not integrate the graphs onto the site due to time limitations 

If We had more time...
We'd have cool weather graphs and make the news more centered and have more information.
